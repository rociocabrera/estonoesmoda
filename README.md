# ESTONOESMODA - Frontend Project

Welcome to the Esto no es Moda - Frontend Project! This project focuses on creating a dynamic and engaging user interface for an online clothing store.

## Installation

Before you begin, ensure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed on your system. We recommend using [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) (Node Version Manager) to manage your Node.js installations. You can follow these steps to get started:

1. Install nvm by following the instructions on the [nvm GitHub repository](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installing-and-updating).
2. Once nvm is installed, open a new terminal window.
3. Install the recommended Node.js version for this project by running:
   
   ```bash
   nvm install <node_version>
   ```
   
   Replace `<node_version>` with the required Node.js version. You can find the recommended version in the `.nvmrc` file in the project directory.

4. Set the installed Node.js version as the default for this project:
   
   ```bash
   nvm use <node_version>
   ```

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/rociocabrera/estonoesmoda.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
